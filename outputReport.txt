=========================
Part 1:

worst case runtime to build AVL is O(N)
because we loop through all the books O(N)
and for each book we may have to make a recursive call but still amortized to O(1)

AVL tree completed
================================
Leafs are evenly dispersed
and the most left and most right nodes are Leafs
showing that the tree is balanced.

Node keys are in proper order from left to right, 
showing searchability.

Both of these factors show that it is a true AVL.
----------------------------------------------
Part 2:

worst case runtime is O(N^2logN)
as the bulk of the computation
is done determining if the the tree is 
a BST (see isSearchable comments in main.cpp).

Creating an RBT
Tree is NOT balanced
Tree is NOT searchable
Tree is NOT an AVL tree
Heres the tree inorder

===========================
As you can can see, the tree is out of order.
This means the tree is not searchable.

Tree is not balanced as the most left node
has a height of one and a right child,
implying that is not balanced

It fails both conditions that make it an AVL tree.
